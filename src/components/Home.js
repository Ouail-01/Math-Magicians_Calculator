        An electronic calculator is typically a portable electronic device used to perform
        calculations,
        ranging from basic arithmetic to complex mathematics.
        The first solid-state electronic calculator was created in the early 1960s.
        Pocket-sized devices became available in the 1970s, especially after the Intel 4004,
        the first microprocessor, was developed by Intel for the Japanese calculator company
        Busicom.
        Modern electronic calculators vary from cheap, give-away,
        credit-card-sized models to sturdy desktop models with built-in printers.
        They became popular in the mid-1970s as the incorporation of integrated circuits reduced
        their size and cost.
        By the end of that decade, prices had dropped to the point where a basic calculator
        was affordable to most and
        they became common in schools.

        By 1970, a calculator could be made using just a few chips of low power consumption,
        allowing portable models powered from rechargeable batteries.
        The first handheld calculator was a 1967 prototype called Cal Tech,
        whose development was led by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments in a research project to
        produce a portable calculator.
        It could add, multiply, subtract, and divide, and its output device was a paper tape.
        [29][30][31][32][33][34] As a result of the &ldquo;Cal-Tech&ldquo; project,
        Texas Instruments was granted master patents on portable calculators.
        The first commercially produced portable calculators appeared in Japan in 1970,
        and were soon marketed around the world.
        These included the Sanyo ICC-0081 &ldquo;Mini Calculator&ldquo;,
        the Canon Pocketronic, and the Sharp QT-8B &ldquo;micro Compet&ldquo;.
        The Canon Pocketronic was a development from the &ldquo;Cal-Tech&ldquo; project.
        It had no traditional display;
        numerical output was on thermal paper tape.
